The Disciplined Disciple Compiler 0.3.1 (2012/12/22)
====================================================

DDC is a research compiler used to investigate program transformation in the
presence of computational effects. This is a development release. There is
enough implemented to experiment with the language, but not enough to solve
actual problems...        (unless you're looking for a compiler to hack on).

DDC compiles several related languages:

 * Disciple Core Lite (Module.dcl)

   Explicitly typed System-F2 style core language with region, effect and
   closure typing. Evaluation is left-to-right call-by-value by default,
   but explicit lazy evaluation is also supported. There is also a capability
   system to track whether objects are mutable or constant, and to ensure that
   computations that perform visible side effects are not suspended with lazy
   evaluation. The Lite language supports higher order functions, algebraic
   data types and unboxed primitive types.
   (not all features are supported by the code generators yet, see below)

 * Disciple Core Salt (Module.dce)

   A cut-down version of Disciple Core Lite that can be easily mapped onto
   C or LLVM code. The Salt language is first-order and does not support
   partial application. DDC transforms Lite code to Salt code and uses Salt as
   an intermediate representation. You can also write programs in it directly.

 * Disciple Core Eval (Module.dcv)

   Similar to Disciple Core Lite, except without unboxed primitive types.
   This language is accepted by the interpreter.

All three languages share the same abstract syntax tree (AST), type checker,
and are amenable to the same program transformations. They differ only in the
set of allowable language features, and which primitive types and operators
are included.


What Works in this Release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Parsing and type checking for the Lite, Salt and Eval languages.

 * Compilation via C and LLVM for first-order Lite and Salt programs.

 * Interpreter for the full Eval language.

 * Cross module inlining.

 * Rewrite rules.

 * Generation of LLVM aliasing and constancy meta-data.

 * Several standard program transformations:
    Anonymize (remove names), Beta (substitute), Bubble (move type-casts),
    Elaborate (add witnesses), Flatten (eliminate nested bindings),
    Forward (let-floating), Namify (add names), Prune (dead-code elimination),
    Snip (eliminate nested applications).


What Doesn't
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * No source locations in error messages.

   The messages themselves are ok, but you don't get a line-number.

 * No storage management.

   There is a fixed 64k heap and when you've allocated that much space the
   runtime just calls abort().

 * No type inference.

   You have to write all your own type applications, including effect and
   closure annotations, which isn't much fun.

 * No multi-module compilation driver.

   DDC isn't restricted to whole-program compilation, but the --make driver
   doesn't handle multiple modules. You'd need to do the linking yourself.

 * No user defined data types.

   Pairs and Lists are baked in, but we don't handle data type declarations.

 * No code generation for lazy evaluation.
   The language semantics and interpreter support it, but the C and LLVM
   code generators do not.

 * No code generation for partial application.

   likewise.


Previous Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * 2012/02 DDC 0.2.0: Project reboot. New core language, working interpreter.

 * 2008/07 DDC 0.1.1: Alpha compiler, constructor classes, more examples.

 * 2008/03 DDC 0.1.0: Alpha compiler, used dependently kinded core language.


Immediate Plans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1) Finish the Coq proof for the core language. We have a hand-done proof for
    an earlier version of the language, and a Coq formalization for a
    System-F2 language with a mutable heap. We need to add regions, effects
    and the capability system to the Coq formalization.

 2) Implement a local type inferencer. The type inferencer will fill in type
    applications as well as effect and closure annotations, but will not
    perform let-generalisation. This is similar the local type inference used
    to support implicits in Coq/Gallina.


How you can help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1) Work through the tutorial on the web-site and send any comments to the
    mailing list. http://disciple.ouroborus.net/wiki/Tutorial/Core

 2) Send bug-reports to the mailing list, or get an account on the trac.

 3) Fix bugs on the trac.

 4) Say hello on the mailing list and we can help you get started on any of
    the main missing features. These are all interesting projects.

 5) Tell your friends.
