DDC Regression Tests
====================

The tests in this directory aim to cover all language features and edge cases in the project, as well as ensure that bugs that are fixed do not get reintroduced.

Specification tests do not go here. Specification tests are more about explaining to someone new to the project how all the features work. For specification tests the focus is more on explanation than coverage.
