DDC Specification Tests
=======================

The tests in this directory aim to systematically exercise every feature described in the language specification. The tests are organized in the same order as the features are described in the specification, so that it's easy to verify that we've got them all. These tests should be written so that someone new to the language can scan through to understand how the syntax and features work. We focus on explanation of features rather than making sure we've covered every edge case.

Regression tests do not go here. Regression tests are more of a mixed bag of things that want to check to ensure that bugs do not get reintroduced. For regression tests the focus is more on coverage than explanation.
