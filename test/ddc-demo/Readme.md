DDC Demos
=========

The tests in this directory are complete small programs that demonstrate how the language can be used. They should me small enough, and interesting enough that one could present them in a conference talk. Only put interesting programs here. Tests which just check for edge cases and regressions should go in ddc-regress instead. Tests that systematically exercise language features should go in ddc-spec instead.
